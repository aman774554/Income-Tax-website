     <center> <h2>History of​ Taxation Pre – 1922</h2></center>

      <img src="h.png" width="1050" height="280">
      <p>It is a matter of general belief that taxes on income and wealth are of recent origin but there is enough evidence to show that taxes on income in some form or the other were levied even in primitive and ancient communities. The origin of the word "Tax" is from "Taxation" which means an estimate. These were levied either on the sale and purchase of merchandise or livestock and were collected in a haphazard manner from time to time. Nearly 2000 years ago, there went out a decree from Ceaser Augustus that all the world should be taxed. In Greece, Germany and Roman Empires, taxes were also levied sometime on the basis of turnover and sometimes on occupations. For many centuries, revenue from taxes went to the Monarch. In Northern England, taxes were levied on land and on moveable property such as the Saladin title in 1188. Later on, these were supplemented by introduction of poll taxes, and indirect taxes known as "Ancient Customs" which were duties on wool, leather and hides. These levies and taxes in various forms and on various commodities and professions were imposed to meet the needs of the Governments to meet their military and civil expenditure and not only to ensure safety to the subjects but also to meet the common needs of the citizens like maintenance of roads, administration of justice and such other functions of the State.</p>

      <h2>Implementation of the Right to Information Act 2005 

in Income Tax Department</h2>
      <img src="right.jpg" width="1050" height="280">
      <p>An order to promote transparency and accountability in the working of public authorities, the Right to Information Act 2005 (RTI Act 2005) empowers the citizens to have access to information under the control of public authorities.

This website aims to provide all information that the Income Tax Department is required to publish in terms of Section 4 of the RTI Act 2005.

The Income Tax Department functions under supervision and control of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). It has around 60,000 personnel located in more than 500 cities and towns across the country. The field offices are divided into regions, and each region is headed by a Chief Commissioner of Income Tax. Every region is assigned annual performance targets, such as revenue collections, and is provided with necessary expenditure budget to meet with its operating expenses.

The Income Tax Act 1961 lays down the frame work or the basis of charge and the computation of total income of a person. It also stipulates the manner in which it is to be brought to tax, defining in detail the exemptions, deductions, rebates and reliefs. The Act defines Income Tax Authorities, their jurisdiction and powers It also lays down the manner of enforcement of the Act by such authorities through an integrated process of assessments, collection and recovery, appeals and revisions, penalties and prosecutions. The Act is fast changing and dynamic in nature and undergoes amendments annually through the Finance Act.</p>
